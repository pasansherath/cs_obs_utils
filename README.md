# cs_obs_utils

## A set of Python utilities to process controlled source seismic data recorded by ocean bottom seismographs (OBSs).

### orient.py
orient.py is a python script to estimate the angle between the airgun shot line and the horizontal components of OBSs. 
It uses a hodogram (particle motion) analysis and a polarisation analysis of the first arriving direct water wave from
the airgun shot recorded by the ocean bottom seismograph.
